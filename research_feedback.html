										<h3> Overview </h3>
										<p>

											Empirical relations between the mass of black holes and the properties (mass, velocity dispersion)
											of their host galaxies imply that their evolution is connected. For massive
											galaxies, it is also thought that energy released by growing
											SMBHs can be an important ingredient in regulating star formation and, in some
											cases, stopping star formation entirely. However, there is still much we don't
											understand about how black holes grow and the nature of
											<span class="tooltip">AGN feedback.
											<span class="tooltiptext">
												When growing a SMBH, shining as active galactic nuclei,
												regulate star formation by injecting energy into its surroundings
											</span>
											</span>
											The reservoir of material available for SMBHs to consume is likely regulated
											by its host galaxy, but also by its own feedback disrupting its nearby gas supply.
											<b>What processes drive and regulate black hole growth? Where and when does
											AGN feedback quench - or shut down completely - star formation?</b>

										</p>

										<h3> An Interesting Relationship With Star Formation</h3>

										By examining black hole growth across thousands of galaxies throughout cosmic time
										in the Romulus simulations, <a href="" target="_blank">we were able to predict that black hole growth
										is closely related to star formation</a>, meaning that galaxies and black holes tend
										to grow together. While this agrees with some observations, we also found very
										little correlation with merger events which is surprising. It also complicates
										the question of black hole feedback. If black holes grow (on average) symbiotically
										with their host galaxy, why does star formation sometimes shut down? It is likely there
										are multiple important processes at play.

            								Effect of Major Mergers
            								<font size="-1">
											Results from three different simulations of the same galaxy, changing its
												last galaxy merger to be more major (2:3) or more minor (1:10). When AGN feedback
												is included, the galaxies that undergo more major mergers quench.
            								</font>
										</figcaption>

										<h3> Connecting SMBH Activity to Galaxy Assembly History</h3>

										<p>The way in which black holes grow and interact with their host galaxy may also depend
										on how their host galaxy forms over time. <a href="">Using a series of zoom-in simulations</a>, we were able to test how black holes and
										galaxy mergers conspire to quench star formation. Utilizing the <a href="">Genetic Modification</a>
										technique, we took a massive galaxy and manipulated the mass ratio of its most recent merger.
										Without SMBHs, this does little to change the overall evolution of the galaxy. However,
										when we do include SMBHs, the simulation with the more major merger quenches entirely
										while the minor merger version remained star forming. While the black hole growth
										remained nearly the same in all simulations, when the galaxy's gas become more
										disrupted during the more major mergers it was able to drive larger, more energetic outflows
											(see side panel for more).</p>

										<p>
											Our group continues this work using the Genetic Modification approach to
											create controlled experiments to test the influence of assembly history
											on SMBH-Galaxy Co-evolution. In addition to merger histories, we can manipulate
											the formation time of the galaxy and its angular momentum. Not only are we
											able to attain higher resolution in these simulations, but this approach is
											uniquely able to isolate important properties of a galaxy's assembly history
											and connect it with its evolution (and that of its SMBH).

            								<font size="-1">
											Results from <a href="">Chadayammuri et al 2021</a>. Gas heated by the black hole
												quickly escapes the galaxy but, as
												it does it slightly influences the entropy profile of the gas around it.
												A steeper profile results is less susceptible to cooling instabilities,
												resulting in less low entropy, cooling gas
												falling to the center (colors represent amount of gas in bins of radius and entropy ,
												lines show the average entropy profile,
												red points mark particles directly heated by the SMBH).

										<h3> A Relatively Gentle Process </h3>
							<p>
       						 	How are these SMBH-driven outflows able to stop star formation? In both <a href=""> Tremmel et al. 2019</a>
								and <a href="">Chadayammuri et al 2021</a> we find that prolonged periods of strong outflow activity is associated
								with the shutdown of star formation. These powerful outflows don't significantly disrupt the galaxy itself,
								but rather they affect the ability for gas on larger scales to cool and fall onto the galaxy.
								This relatively gentle process is able to shut off the galaxy's supply of gas without
								significant disruption. The gas within or near the galaxy is not super heated, nor
								is it blown away.
							</p>
										<h3> Testing New Models for Black Hole Feedback </h3>
										<p>
											Despite its importance, we understand very little about the physics of AGN
											feedback. How do SMBHs transfer energy to surrounding gas and how is this connected
											to the properties of the black holes themselves, such as their growth rate,
											mass, and spin? Such an open-ended problem means we have plenty of room
											to experiment with new models, which we develop in our group and then test
											with high resolution simulations and controlled experiments. Utilizing Genetic
											Modification, we can explore how changing models for feedback results in different
											interactions with a galaxy's assembly history.

											<h3>Black Hole Feedback and Gas Kinematics</h3>
											<p>In <a href="">Sanchez et al. 2019</a>  we find that even minor mergers
											can result in significant episodes of black hole feedback. The important thing
											is disrupting the rotation of the gaseous disk of the galaxy. Once this occurs, black
											holes are able to drive stronger outflows and regulate cooling. Higher resolution,
												much more detailed simulations will be an
											important test of this theory more fully. It will also allow us to explore
											more complex structure of gas nearby SMBHs.</p>

											<h3>Earliest Phases of Black Hole Growth and Feedback</h3>
											<p> <b>How do supermassive black holes get so massive and how are
												some able to grow to more than a billion solar masses within the first
												billion years of the Universe?</b>
												Another advantage of higher resolution simulations is that it allows
											us to resolve smaller and earlier structures in the Universe, including the
											formation sites of newly formed black holes. Understanding the effect that
											growing black holes have on their surroundings is a crucial ingredient toward
											understanding their earliest phases of growth and answering this question.
