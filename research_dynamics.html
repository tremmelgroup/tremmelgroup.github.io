            								SMBH Dynamics and Galaxy Merger Properties
            							<font size="-1">
                How long it takes a SMBH to reach the center of its new galaxy after a galaxy merger depends on the properties
                of the merging galaxies. SMBHs in more diffuse, small galaxies will see their former hosts tidally disrupted
                by the larger galaxy, leaving them on a wide orbit that will take billions of years to decay through dynamical
                friction (<b>top</b>). On the other hand, SMBHs in more massive, denser galaxies will maintain a dense core of stars
                around them throughout the merger. This massive remnant of the former host galaxy will aid in brining
                the galaxy closer to the center (<b>bottom</b>).

    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p>
        SMBHs form in the centers of young galaxies in the early Universe. These young galaxies are the "building blocks"
        of more massive galaxies and, as these smaller galaxies merge to form larger and larger galaxies, their SMBHs are
        thought to form binary systems and eventually merge, emitting gravitational waves that we will be able to
        detect with future space-based observatories like <a href="https://lisa.nasa.gov/">LISA</a>. Understanding where and
        when these mergers are likely to take place will be critical to understanding and interpretting gravitational wave data,
        which, given the proper theoretical context, will provide a unique view into SMBH evolution through cosmic time.
        <b>To accomplish this we need a better understanding of how SMBHs
            move within their host galaxies.</b> With cosmological simualtions that utilize a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07609"> Dynamical Friction</a>
        model, we can study SMBH orbital evolution within galaxies in a way that has never before been possible.
    </p>
										<h3>Research Goals</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Study the dynamical evolution of massive black hole pairs in merging galaxies</li>
											<li>Better understand the timescale to form a massive binary black hole and
											how this would affect predictions for gravitational wave detectors</li>
											<li>Predict the multiwavelength signatures associated with the formation of a massive
											black hole binary, including when black hole pairs may shine as <span class=tooltip>
													dual AGN
													<span class="tooltiptext"> Dual Active Galactic Nuclei are systems observed
														to have multiple black holes that are growing fast enough to emit light
														and be observed as AGN.</span> </span>
											</li>
											<li>Predict and characterize the population of off-center SMBHs in the Universe</li>
										</ul>

    <h3>Formation of Close SMBH Pairs</h3>
    <p>
        It is commonly thought that when two galaxies merge, their respective SMBHs will also merge relatively quickly.
        Using the <a href="romulus.html"> Romulus25</a> cosmological simulation, we can examine how often and after how long SMBHs
        form close pairs (the precursors to SMBH binaries and mergers) after their galaxies merge. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07126">
        We find that the formation
        of close pairs (and therefore also SMBH mergers) is actually rather uncommon and often takes billions of years
        following galaxy mergers</a>. This delay depends on the properties of the host galaxy and
		<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...904...16B/abstract">can significantly affect predictions
		for LISA detection rates</a>. In massive galaxies, minor mergers are common and, we predict, should result in many
		<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.6098R/abstract">wandering SMBHs</a>, including within galaxies of
		<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...857L..22T/abstract">similar mass to our own Milky Way.</a>
    </p>

	<h3>High Resolution Zoom-in Simulations of Galaxy Mergers</h3>
	<p>
		LISA will be most powerful in its ability to detect mergers between relatively low mass black holes (as
		small as a few thousand solar masses) within low mass galaxies out to incredibly early times. This is important
		because it means LISA will potentially probe the very early population of recently formed massive black holes.
		While Romulus has been great at building a statistical idea of black hole mergers over cosmic time, such large simulations
		remain significantly limited in resolution. We select dwarf galaxy mergers from Romulus at z > 2 that result in SMBH
		mergers in that simulation, then re-simulate those galaxies at much higher resolution. Such zoom-in simulations will
		provide a great deal more detail in tracking the devolution of the black hole pairs, as well as determining
		the environment that black hole binaries detected with LISA are likely to reside within.

											<h3>Dual and Offset AGN</h3>
											<p>When and where do massive black holes shine during galaxy mergers? Dual AGN
											may indicate a period of black hole growth driven by the merger itself. It may also
											be a precursor stage to a black hole merger event. We need simulations to
											help put them into context.</p>

											<p>The image above represents two snapshots of the same galaxy merger event
												in Romulus, during
											which both black holes are actively growing such that they'd likely be detectable as
											AGN. Note that in one case we can make out two distinct galaxies, while later on
											during the merger, the black holes are very close and within the same galaxy.</p>

											<h3>Wandering SMBHs</h3>
											<p>
												Massive black hole pairs in merging galaxies have a variety of fates. Some
												will form binaries and merge, but many will not. Our simulations predict a
												significant population of "wandering" black holes far from the galactic center
												and (mostly) inert and very hard to see. These black holes were left behind from
												a past merger event where their host was disrupted by a more massive galaxy,
												leaving its black hole on a very wide orbit, never to reach the center of its
												new host galaxy.
											</p>

											<p>
												We have used Romulus to study these wanderers in some detail, finding that
												they typically have very low mass, with numbers that scale very closely to
												the mass of their host galaxy's dark matter halo
												<a href="" target="_blank">(Ricarte et al. 2021a)</a>. We also predict that some
												may be luminous enough to see! The image above is from
												<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...916L..18R/abstract">Ricarte et al. 2021b</a>
												and shows the location
												of all wandering black holes (left, middle) as well as those that are bright
												enough in the x-ray to detect (right). It may be possible, with techniques like
												X-ray stacking, to detect the presence of wandering black holes.
