										<h3> Overview </h3>
										<p>
      									  <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.470.1121T/abstract" target="_blank">
											  The Romulus simulations</a> are large-scale cosmological simulations with resolution on par
											with the highest resolution simulations of this type run to date. The simulations are run with the most
											current cosmological parameters. Our flagship simulation is Romulus25, a uniform cosmological volume
       										of 25 Mpc per side (about 80 million light  years). Romulus25 provides a sample of <b>1000s of galaxies ranging
        									from dwarf galaxies to massive galaxies at the centers of small groups</b>.
											<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.3336T/abstract" target="_blank"> RomulusC </a>
											is a zoom-in simulation of a galaxy cluster of 10<sup>14</sup> solar masses,
											representing one of the highest resolution simulations to date of such a massive system.

										<h3> A novel implementation of SMBH physics </h3>
	<p>
        An important and unique strength of the Romulus simulations is the careful implementation of SMBH physics, designed
        to provide a physically motivated sub-grid model for SMBH formation, dynamics, growth, and feedback that will
        be suited to study questions relevant to modern and future observations of SMBHs and active galactic nuclei (AGN).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Seeding SMBHs in the early Universe based on gas properties </b> allows Romulus to predict where and when
        SMBHs grow independent of any assumptions about what galaxies they exist in. It also allows us to follow SMBH
        growth at early times and in a variety of environments, including dwarf and satellite galaxies.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>An accretion model that accounts for angular momentum support</b> is crucial for modeling SMBH growth in
        disk-dominated galaxies. By connecting accretion to the gas kinematics, Romulus can give us a better picture
        of the different modes of SMBH growth (e.g. growth within disk galaxies vs actively merging galaxies).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Accounting for unresolved dynamical friction</b> acting on SMBHs allows Romulus to accurately track
        the orbital evolution of SMBHs within galaxies to sub-kpc accuracy. This is crucial for understanding phases of SMBH
        growth during perturvative events like mergers. It is also important for modeling when and where SMBHs will
        form binaries and potentially merge to better interpret and predict results from future gravitational wave
		missions like LISA. For more on this, check out
		our research on <a href="research_dynamics.html">black hole dynamics.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>A careful implementation of feedback</b>, combined with improved hydrodynamics and high resolution,
        allows for an accurate representation
        of how SMBHs interact not only with their immediate environment, but the host galaxy as a whole.
        Our model is able to avoid any ad hoc prescriptions for wind or "bubble" formation that often require heavy handed
        assumptions about the nature of SMBH feedback. For more on this, check out our research
		on <a href="research_feedback.html">how feedback affects galaxy evolution.</a>

											<h3>Tracking the Evolution of Thousands of Galaxies</h3>
											<p>The main advantage to large-scale simulations like Romulus
											is the ability to simultaneously track the evolution of a statistically
											significant population of galaxies across many different environments.
											Our team of collaborators has used these simulations in a variety of ways
											to learn about galaxy evolution. </p>

											<h3>SMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies</h3>
											<p>Improving our implementation of black hole physics allows us to use simulations
											to make new predictions. Romulus forms black holes based on local gas properties, allowing
											them to exist in low mass galaxies, where other simulations usually ignore them.
											This allows us to predict how the fraction of galaxies hosting black holes evolves with
												stellar mass and time (image above, from
												<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220305580S/abstract">Sharma et al. 2022</a>). </p>

											<p>
												In Sharma et al. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..103S/abstract">2020</a> and
												<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220305580S/abstract">2022</a>, we examine the population of black holes in
												low mass galaxies and make predictions for how luminous they may appear.
												We find good agreement to observations of active galactic nuclei in dwarf galaxies
												and predict a significant population that remains hidden from us. We are
												currently working to understand how the black hole occupation in low
												mass galaxies depends on environment, as well as how SMBHs may result
												in quenched, isolated dwarf galaxies. Check out the
												<a href="../recent_results.html">recent results</a> page for updates!
