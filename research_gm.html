										<h3> Controlled Experiments with Genetic Modification </h3>
										<p>
      									  Galaxies form in the centers of dark matter halos, large, gravitationally bound
											structures of dark matter. The evolution of dark matter halos and galaxies is
											strongly connected. Gas traces dark matter, so the faster a dark matter halo
											grows, so too is their more material to create a galaxy. More mergers between
											dark matter halos implies more mergers between galaxies as well. The
											<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.455..974R/abstract" target="_blank">
												Genetic Modification Technique</a>, pioneered by the <a href="https://gmgalaxies.org/" target="_blank">
											GM galaxies </a> group led by Professor Andrew Pontzen at
											University College London, is able to manipulate specific aspects of a dark
											matter halo's assembly history, such as the number and mass ratio of its mergers,
											or its final mass, formation time, or rotation. It conducts these manipulations
											in a way that preserves each other aspect of the halo's properties. For example,
											we can change the mass ratio of a merger event without changing its final mass
											or its large scale environment. In collaboration with
											Andrew Pontzen and his group, we utilize this technique to conduct controlled
											experiments to test the influence a halo's assembly history
											on the evolution of the galaxy and supermassive black hole(s) that it hosts.

											<h3><a href="research_xgal.html">A New Suite of Zoom-in Simulations</a></h3>
											<p>
												It is common for simulators to run a number of high resolution, zoom-in cosmological
												simulations of individual galaxies. Our group does things slightly differently.
												Rather than run a suite of completely different galaxies, we instead
												use Genetic Modification to explore different variations on the same
												galaxy's assembly history. Combining this with testing different model
												variations, we have a powerful set of controlled experiments relating
												the merger and mass growth history of a  galaxy to its evolution
												and that of its supermassive black hole(s).
											</p>

											<h3>An Important Laboratory for Testing New Physics Models</h3>
											<p>
												There is a tremendous amount of uncertainty around how supermassive
												black holes grow and interact with their environment. Implementing new
												models into our simulations in order to make new predictions for observations
												is a major priority of our group. Genetic
												Modification allows us to examine now only how different SMBH models affect the
												evolution of galaxies, but also how this may change the way galaxies are
												affected by their formation history. In other words, it is possible that
												two different models can create galaxies that looks similar in many ways. However,
												it may be that one model is affected more (or less) by
												variation's to its host galaxy's assembly history. Such experiments add a new
												dimension to testing new models for SMBH physics.
